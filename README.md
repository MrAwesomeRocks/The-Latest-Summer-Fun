# The Latest Summer Fun: Super Special New Edition (Gluten Free)

Welcome to the Latest Summer Fun: Super Special New Edition (Gluten Free), a magitechadventure modpack for 1.16.5. What does any of that mean, you may ask? Well, let me tell you.

By magitechadventure, I mean it's got a touch of magic, a sprinkling of tech, and some adventure in the mix there too. Nothing groundbreaking by modpack standards, it's just meant to be something I can mess around in with my friends. I even went as far as to add custom food to give uses to some of the more useless crops! It's a fun time, and if you're not playing, you're missing out on the Latest Summer Fun.

Why is it called that when it's not being released in summer? Because this is the pre-release, it will only be ready for official release by the time summer rolls around. Or maybe before then, who knows.
